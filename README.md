# A propos

Data scrapped from https://www.foxnews.com/ during 2020 elections.

Unfortunately, only data from the presidential by state and from 2020/11/04 12:09 East time is available.

Anyone who have missing data is welcome to contribute, especially for data in the late evening of 2020/11/04.

It could be just a capture (browser>save type) from foxnews.com, or any other source. We would need to make
sure tour data is legit, as data integrity is important to us.

No authorization was asked to FoxNews to distribute this data. We believe this kind of data should be 
open and available to everyone in a democracy. We don't know where is the official governement source the media
use to get the results, please share if you know.

If you have a problem with this or needs more credits (especially FoxNews...), please contact us.
